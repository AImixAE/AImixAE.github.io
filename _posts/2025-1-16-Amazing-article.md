# Amazing article

## 原文

![Pic](/assets/img/posts/2025-1-16-Amazing-article/png1.png)

## 原文修正

```
Oh! Shirt!
    ^^^^^
Oh, shit !
```

大概是买了个衬衫觉得很好看

```
I'm very want to      a friend.
 ^^ ^^^^
I really want to make a friend.
```

这就是传说中的 `be do` 和 `very do` 吗?!

```
But I'm very shcore.
             ^^^^^^
But I'm very shy   .
```

这是什么单词? 硬修吧

```
Oh! My school food is a bad.
                      ^
Oh! My school food is   bad.
```

你看吧, 老师说什么来着, `冠词` 后面加 `adj.`

```
Now! I'm don't like eat    school's food.
^^^   ^^            ^^^          ~~
     I   don't like eating school food.
```

现在激励时!要用现在一般式 梅开二度(`be do`) 传奇`like do`
一致一点不好吗(`school's food`)?

```
Can your know me?
    ^^^^ ~~~~
Do you know why?
```

我的知道怎么了? 我为什么要认识你? 又不提供姓名...

```
oh! I like eat    some luke food.
~          ^^^         ^^^^
Oh! I like eating some luck food.
```

梅开二度(`like do`) 路克是什么食物?
幸运食物又是什么食物??!

```
But my mother is dArrot me eat some.
              ^^ ^^^^^^    ^^^ ~~~~
But my mother disagrees me to eat these.
```

梅开三度(`be do`) `to do` 变成 `ToDo(待办清单)` 了

```
She tell  me:
    ^^^^    ~
She tells me,
```

动词考虑什么?用啥!

```
"Their is a luck food! It's not healthy."
    ~     ^
"There is   luck food! It's not healthy."
```

他们的是... 不可数名词考虑什么?冠词!

```
Oh! What can I see?
               ^^^
Oh! What can I say?
```

假如给我三天光明, 我就能看见牢大的经典语录了

## 全文:
Oh, shit! I really want to make a friend. But I'm very shy. Oh! My school food is bad. I don't like eating school food. Do you know why? Oh! I like eating some luck food. But my mother disagrees me to eat these. She tells me, "There is luck food! It's not healthy." Oh! What can I say?

看来这篇作文很燃, 一堆 `Oh!`
所以说为什么你不喜欢吃学校的食物???

## 翻译:
该死！我真的很想交个朋友。但我很害羞。哦！我的学校食物很糟糕。我不喜欢吃学校的食物。你知道为什么吗? 哦！我喜欢吃一些幸运的食物。但我妈妈不同意我吃这些。她告诉我，“有幸运食物！这不健康。”哦！我能说什么呢?
